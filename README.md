# portfolio

A Flutter project.

## Getting Started

in this project i use home_screen.dart as the first screen. 
home_screen.dart contains a bottom nav bar. 
what appears in the body is contact.dart, portfolio.dart, profile.dart.
contact.dart have a column of email and number if presssed it will link to the associated app using mailto: and telp:. 
portfolio.dart it have a grid of card which is build using the data from portfolio_repository.dart. 
and lastly profile which have my name and photo in a card on the centre of the screen. 

## Difficulty

The Most difficult part for me is dealing with overflow. this is in part because i don't want my app to scroll if i make is scrollable i would't need to deal with overflow.
